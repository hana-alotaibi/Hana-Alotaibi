## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

## Memor Game Attempt

Page shows 16 cards, back side. Above, I find rating, timer , moves counter and a re start icon. Upon clicking a card, face is revealed. If 2 cards are matched it will stay on face side, if not, both cards will return to back side. Once all cards are matched, a congratulation will pop up. Also, results will be available which include how many moves did it take to match all cards, star ratings according to number of moves, time spent during the game in seconds,  and a button to play again.
